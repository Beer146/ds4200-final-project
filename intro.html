    <h1>Sector Trends in the NIFTY-50 (2000–2021)</h1>
  
    <p>
      This project explores how three major sectors in the Indian stock market —
      <strong>Technology, Finance, and Energy</strong> — have evolved from 2000 to 2021 within the
      NIFTY-50 index. The NIFTY-50 represents 50 of the largest and most actively traded companies
      on the National Stock Exchange of India. We focus on long-term sector behavior to understand
      how different parts of the economy grow, react to crises, and contribute to overall market performance.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Our main goals are to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare sector performance over time using returns and cumulative returns.</li>
      <li>Examine sector <strong>volatility</strong> and how risk changes around major events like the 2008 global recession and the 2020 COVID-19 shock.</li>
      <li>Analyze how <strong>trading activity</strong> (volume) relates to returns across sectors.</li>
      <li>Build interactive visualizations that let users explore how sector behavior changes across years.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Data Description</h2>
  
    <p>
      We use the <strong>“NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data (2000–2021)”</strong> dataset from Kaggle. The full dataset
      contains daily price and volume data for all 50 NIFTY-50 companies, with each company stored in a separate CSV file
      and roughly 1,000–3,000 daily observations and around 15 columns per file (including date, OHLC prices, and volume). 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For this project, we focus on 12 representative stocks: four from each of the three sectors.
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Infosys (INFY), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies (HCLTECH), Wipro (WIPRO)</li>
      <li><strong>Finance</strong>: HDFC Bank (HDFCBANK), ICICI Bank (ICICIBANK), State Bank of India (SBIN), Kotak Mahindra Bank (KOTAKBANK)</li>
      <li><strong>Energy</strong>: Reliance Industries (RELIANCE), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), NTPC (NTPC), Power Grid Corporation (POWERGRID)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      From the raw daily data, we compute derived metrics such as daily returns, sector-level average returns,
      average trading volume, and cumulative sector returns over time. These transformed features feed into our
      Altair and D3 visualizations on the main page.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Why This Data Works for Our Topic</h2>
  
    <p>
      This dataset is well-suited to our topic because it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Covers more than <strong>20 years</strong> of trading history (2000–2021), allowing us to study long-term trends.</li>
      <li>Includes <strong>continuous variables</strong> (prices, returns, volume) and <strong>categorical variables</strong> (sector, symbol).</li>
      <li>Contains enough observations to smooth out noise and still reveal clear sector-level patterns.</li>
      <li>Captures major market events (dot-com aftermath, 2008 crisis, COVID-19) within the time window.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      One limitation is that we only use 4 companies per sector, so our sector-level results are an approximation of the
      true full sector behavior. In addition, the dataset focuses on price and volume, so it does not include fundamentals
      such as earnings, balance sheet ratios, or macroeconomic indicators that could also affect sector performance.
    </p>

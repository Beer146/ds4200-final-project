    <h1>Technology Sector Analysis (2004-2021)</h1>

    <div class="sector-overview">
      <h2>📊 Sector Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Technology sector comprises four major Indian IT services companies: 
        <strong>Infosys (INFY)</strong>, <strong>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)</strong>, 
        <strong>HCL Technologies (HCLTECH)</strong>, and <strong>Wipro (WIPRO)</strong>. 
        These companies represent the backbone of India's $227 billion IT industry, providing 
        software development, consulting, and business process outsourcing to global clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our analysis spans <strong>4,139 trading days</strong> from August 25, 2004 to April 30, 2021, 
        chosen to align with TCS's IPO date. This 17-year period encompasses major economic events 
        including the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>

    <h2>1. Stock Price History (2004-2021)</h2>
    <iframe 
        src="tech_stock_prices.html"
        width="100%"
        height="650"
        style="border: none; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 10px;">
    </iframe>

    <div class="analysis-box">
      <h3>📈 Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Stock price history reveals the long-term trajectory and resilience 
        of each company. Unlike cumulative returns (which normalize to a starting value of 1), actual 
        prices show the real rupee value that investors would have seen in their portfolios.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Observations:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>TCS</strong> demonstrated the most consistent upward trajectory, growing from ₹200-300 at IPO to over ₹3,000 by 2021</li>
        <li><strong>HCL Tech</strong> experienced a dramatic surge between 2012-2017, quintupling from ₹400 to ₹2,000+</li>
        <li><strong>Infosys and Wipro</strong> showed stagnation, with prices in 2021 barely above their 2007 peaks</li>
        <li>The 2008 crisis caused 40-60% declines across all stocks, but recovery patterns diverged significantly</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>💡 Takeaway:</strong> The price chart reveals that within the same booming sector, 
        individual stock selection mattered enormously. TCS investors saw 15x gains while Infosys/Wipro 
        investors barely broke even over 17 years.

    <h2>2. Rolling Volatility (Risk Profile)</h2>
    <iframe 
        src="tech_volatility.html"
        width="100%"
        height="650"
        style="border: none; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 10px;">
    </iframe>

    <div class="analysis-box">
      <h3>📊 Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Volatility measures the standard deviation of daily returns over a 
        60-day rolling window, annualized by multiplying by √252. It quantifies risk—high volatility means 
        larger price swings and greater uncertainty for investors. This metric is crucial for portfolio 
        management and understanding risk-adjusted returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Observations:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>2008 Crisis:</strong> Volatility spiked to unprecedented levels of 120%+, indicating extreme market panic and daily price swings exceeding 7-8%</li>
        <li><strong>COVID-19 (2020):</strong> Volatility reached 60-105%, severe but recovering faster than 2008, showing market confidence in tech sector resilience</li>
        <li><strong>TCS</strong> maintained the lowest average volatility (32.26%) over the period—a hallmark of stable, predictable performance</li>
        <li><strong>HCL Tech</strong> showed highest volatility (37.24%), reflecting its dramatic growth spurts and higher risk profile</li>
        <li>Infosys and Wipro had similar volatility to HCL but without commensurate returns—the worst risk/reward profile</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>💡 Takeaway:</strong> TCS achieved superior returns with lower volatility—the ideal combination. 
        Meanwhile, Infosys and Wipro demonstrated that high risk doesn't guarantee high returns. Volatility analysis 
        helps investors understand what level of portfolio fluctuation to expect.

    <h2>3. Trading Volume Trends</h2>
    <iframe 
        src="tech_volume.html"
        width="100%"
        height="650"
        style="border: none; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 10px;">
    </iframe>

    <div class="analysis-box">
      <h3>📊 Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Trading volume indicates market liquidity and investor interest. High volume 
        suggests active trading and easy entry/exit, while volume spikes during crises reveal panic selling 
        or opportunistic buying. Volume trends also reflect changing market capitalization and institutional 
        ownership over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Observations:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Long-term growth:</strong> All four stocks showed increasing trading volume from 2004 to 2021, reflecting growing market capitalization and investor participation</li>
        <li><strong>Crisis spikes:</strong> Both 2008 and 2020 saw dramatic volume increases as investors rushed to reposition portfolios</li>
        <li><strong>TCS volume surge post-2018:</strong> Trading volume nearly doubled, coinciding with its emergence as India's most valuable IT company (₹12+ trillion market cap)</li>
        <li><strong>Infosys maintained highest average volume</strong> throughout the period due to its large institutional ownership and index weight</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>💡 Takeaway:</strong> High trading volume ensures that investors can buy or sell large 
        positions without significantly moving the price. All four tech stocks maintain excellent liquidity, 
        making them suitable for institutional portfolios. Volume spikes during crises created both risks 
        (panic selling) and opportunities (buying at depressed prices).

        style="border: none; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 10px;">
    </iframe>

    <div class="analysis-box">
      <h3>📊 Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Annual returns break down performance year-by-year, revealing consistency 
        versus volatility. A stock might have good cumulative returns but get there through extreme ups and 
        downs. Annual data helps investors understand the year-to-year experience of holding these stocks 
        and identify periods of outperformance or underperformance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Observations:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>2008:</strong> All stocks posted negative returns (−40% to −60%), confirming sector-wide impact of the financial crisis</li>
        <li><strong>2009 recovery:</strong> Strong rebounds (40-80% gains) as markets recovered and IT outsourcing demand surged</li>
        <li><strong>2012-2017:</strong> HCL Tech's golden era with consistent 20-40% annual returns, driven by aggressive client acquisition</li>
        <li><strong>2020:</strong> Despite COVID, tech stocks posted positive returns as digital transformation accelerated globally</li>
        <li><strong>TCS consistency:</strong> Fewer extreme down years compared to peers, demonstrating stable business model</li>
        <li><strong>Infosys/Wipro:</strong> Multiple negative years (2011, 2013, 2015-2018), explaining their poor cumulative performance</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>💡 Takeaway:</strong> The interactive chart reveals that TCS achieved superior long-term 
        returns not through spectacular individual years, but through consistency—fewer down years and steady 
        positive performance. HCL Tech had higher peaks but also deeper valleys. For long-term investors, 
        consistency often beats volatility.

      <h3>📊 Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> This scatter plot synthesizes our entire analysis into a single powerful 
        visualization. The x-axis shows average volatility (risk), the y-axis shows total return (reward), 
        and the Sharpe Ratio (shown on hover) measures risk-adjusted return. The ideal position is 
        top-left: high returns with low risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Observations:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>TCS (Top-Left Quadrant):</strong> 207% return with 32.26% volatility = Best risk-adjusted performance. Sharpe Ratio confirms this is the optimal investment</li>
        <li><strong>HCL Tech (Top-Center):</strong> 182% return but 37.24% volatility = High reward but also high risk. Good for aggressive investors</li>
        <li><strong>Infosys & Wipro (Bottom-Right):</strong> Negative returns despite high volatility = Worst possible outcome. High risk without reward</li>
        <li>The quadrant lines show that only TCS and HCL Tech exceeded both average sector return and average sector volatility positively</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>💡 Takeaway:</strong> This chart answers "Which stock should I buy?" 
        For risk-averse investors seeking steady growth: <strong>TCS</strong> (lower-left, best risk-adjusted). 
        For aggressive growth investors willing to accept volatility: <strong>HCL Tech</strong> (top-center, highest returns). 
        Avoid: <strong>Infosys/Wipro</strong> (bottom-right, high risk with negative returns). The visualization 
        demonstrates that within the same sector, risk-return profiles can differ dramatically.

    <div class="conclusions-box">
      <h2>🎯 Overall Technology Sector Conclusions</h2>
      
      <h3>Investment Implications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sector doesn't guarantee success:</strong> Despite India's IT boom delivering 261% average returns, 
            individual stock selection was critical—you could still pick losers (Infosys/Wipro with negative returns)</li>
        
        <li><strong>Market leadership premium:</strong> TCS's position as India's largest IT company (by revenue and 
            market cap) translated to superior risk-adjusted returns. Market leaders often deliver more predictable results</li>
        
        <li><strong>Growth vs. Volatility trade-off:</strong> HCL Tech achieved spectacular returns (182%) but required 
            tolerance for 37% volatility. Investors must match stock choice to risk tolerance</li>
        
        <li><strong>Crisis resilience varies:</strong> The 2008 crisis revealed long-term divergence: TCS/HCL recovered 
            strongly while Infosys/Wipro never regained momentum. Recovery patterns predict long-term success</li>
        
        <li><strong>COVID accelerated tech dominance:</strong> Unlike 2008 (which took years to recover), tech stocks 
            bounced back quickly from COVID as digital transformation became urgent for all businesses</li>
      </ul>

        of growth and stability, HCL Tech offered higher returns for risk-tolerant investors, while 
        Infosys and Wipro demonstrated that even in a booming sector, poor execution leads to 
        value destruction despite high volatility.
